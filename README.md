IPL Match Outcome Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict cricket match outcomes using historical Indian Premier League (IPL) data. By leveraging match and delivery-level data, the project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the winner of a cricket match at any given point during the game based on real-time match conditions.

Datasets Used
matches.csv – contains match-level information such as season, city, teams, toss winner, winner, result, etc.

deliveries.csv – contains ball-by-ball records of each match including batting and bowling details, runs scored, extras, wickets, and more.

Project Workflow and Key Steps
Data Loading and Exploration

Read matches and deliveries datasets.

Inspect data structure and columns to understand match-specific and delivery-specific data.

Feature Engineering

Merge match-level and ball-by-ball data to create a comprehensive dataset including:

Current score

Runs left to win

Balls left in innings

Wickets fallen

Current run rate (CRR)

Required run rate (RRR)

These features help capture the context of a match dynamically.

Data Preprocessing

Encode categorical features such as batting team, bowling team, and venue city using one-hot encoding.

Retain numerical features relevant to the state of the match.

Model Pipeline Construction

Construct a pipeline using ColumnTransformer and OneHotEncoder for categorical encoding.

Use logistic regression for classification of the winning team.

Model Training and Evaluation

Train the logistic regression model on the engineered dataset.

Evaluate using metrics such as accuracy through appropriate validation techniques (e.g., train/test split or cross-validation).

Features Used for Prediction
Batting team

Bowling team

City (venue)

Runs left to win

Balls left in innings

Wickets fallen

Total runs scored by batting team so far

Current run rate (CRR)

Required run rate (RRR)

Objective
The model predicts the probability of the batting team winning the match based on current match conditions, allowing real-time forecasting during a match.

Potential Applications
Real-time match predictions and insights for broadcasters and viewers.

Strategic decision-making support for teams and coaches.

Enhanced fan engagement through predictive analytics.

Technologies and Libraries
Python 3.8+

pandas, numpy for data manipulation

scikit-learn for machine learning pipeline (ColumnTransformer, OneHotEncoder, LogisticRegression)

matplotlib for any visualizations (if extended)
